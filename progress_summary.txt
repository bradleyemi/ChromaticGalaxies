For the SURF project our goal was to create a basis set of galaxies from AEGIS f606w
and f814w filters for implementation in ChromaticRealGalaxy. This document should be
helpful to anyone who is going to continue to work on the project. It specifies what has
already been implemented, and what still needs to be done.

Done:

- sextractor was used to create catalogs of objects
- a star/galaxy selection cut was chosen
- for each of the ACS images, identified what the focus position was, by comparing 
stars in the image with the Tiny Tim star fields and put the focus position into the 
catalogs from sextractor.
- cut out postage stamps of galaxies (stamp size 4*half light radius, may need to be updated). 
- cut out corresponding inverse weight files, and PSFs.
- some initial sample characterization was done. 

Work left to do:

- generate_masks is not quite ready out of the box. Some minor tweaks need to be made
to make it more general (no more local dependencies)
and generate_masks can be incorporated into the main script run.py. 
- parametric models of galaxies. IDL code works on the first 500 galaxies, but it is
quite slow. modified_make_input (in the repo) needs to be updated to be more general, 
but it overall provides a jumping off point for making input to Claire's code.
-addition of photo-z's into the catalogs. 
-better sample characterization. More plots and sanity checks of various quantities.
there are lots that can be done. 
-incorporation of the models into galsim. Rachel Mandelbaum has code for this.
-assoc_catalogs only works for two filters. We want to be able to associate objects in
catalogs in multiple filters with reasonable computational efficiency. 
-flexibility, and incorporation of different images. we assume the images are all HST-ACS
images in f606w and f814w filters. We need more TT fields to expand it out and we'd also 
need to change some code if the image borders are different, examine how diffraction
spikes behave in the other filters, etc. 
-We ultimately want to use more infrared fields, and also deeper fields.
